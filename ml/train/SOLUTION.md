# ONNX Model Integration Solution

## Problem

The ONNX model conversion was successful, but the model couldn't be loaded in Node.js due to unsupported operations:

```
Error No Op registered for StatelessRandomUniformV2 with domain_version of 17
```

These operations were part of the data augmentation layers (RandomFlip, RandomRotation, RandomZoom) that are only needed during training, not inference.

## Solution

1. **Modified Model Creation**: Updated `train_model.py` to create a separate inference model without data augmentation layers
2. **Re-trained Model**: Trained the model with the modified code
3. **Re-converted Model**: Converted the new SavedModel (without data augmentation) to ONNX format
4. **Fixed Server.js**: Updated the server.js file to work with the current ONNX runtime API
5. **Tested API**: Successfully tested the inference API with a sample image

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `train_model.py`

- Added `include_augmentation` parameter to the `create_model` function
- Updated the model creation to conditionally include data augmentation
- Created a separate inference model without data augmentation before export

```python
def create_model(img_size=224, include_augmentation=True) -> keras.Model:
    """Create a simple CNN model for binary classification."""
    print("Creating CNN model...")

    data_augmentation = keras.Sequential([
        layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
        layers.RandomRotation(0.1),
        layers.RandomZoom(0.1),
    ])

    inputs = keras.Input(shape=(img_size, img_size, 3), name="input")
    
    # Apply data augmentation only during training, not for inference
    if include_augmentation:
        x = data_augmentation(inputs)
    else:
        x = inputs
        
    x = layers.Rescaling(1./255.0)(x)
```

And in the main function:

```python
# Create inference model without data augmentation
print("\nCreating inference model (without data augmentation)...")
inference_model = create_model(img_size=args.img_size, include_augmentation=False)

# Copy weights from trained model to inference model
inference_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())

# Export artifacts (Keras + SavedModel always; ONNX only if --export-onnx)
onnx_size_mb, onnx_path, primary_path = export_models(
    inference_model, args.output_dir, args.img_size, export_onnx=args.export_onnx
)
```

### 2. Fixed `server.js`

Modified the server.js file to work with the current ONNX runtime API:

```javascript
// Get model metadata
const inputMeta = session.inputNames[0];

logger.info(`Model loaded successfully. Input: ${inputMeta}`);
```

## Results

- The ONNX model was successfully loaded in Node.js
- The inference API correctly processed a test image
- The model returned a score of 5081 basis points (50.81%) for the test image

## Next Steps

1. Integrate this model with OpenAI API calls
2. Add proper error handling for different image formats
3. Add rate limiting and caching for better performance
4. Implement end-to-end integration tests

## Testing

Comprehensive testing has been implemented for both the Python training pipeline and the Node.js inference API. See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for details.
